              As a bit about me, I was first introduced to programming during
              furlough in 2020. I was trying to step out of my comfort zone
              whilst I had the opportunity and wanted to learn something new. I
              started with a free Python course offered as part of a government
              scheme and whilst I was doing this saw an advert on Facebook for a
              free online workshop with a company called SheCodes. After
              attending the workshop, I couldn't wait to start learning. Six
              months on and I had completed the SheCodes beginner workshop,
              SheCodes Plus workshop and SheCodes React workshop. Links to my
              certificates and final projects can be found on the links at the
              top of this page, and further information on the workshops and
              course content can be found{" "}

            <p>
              After I completed the SheCodes workshops in January 2021, I
              continued to work in my role of Customer Success Manager and
              started to explore Swift Playgrounds. I decided to start an iOS
              App Development Bootcamp on Udemy in April 2021 and left my role
              in July to focus on further developing my skills and to move into
              a career in web or app development. This bootcamp has been a great
              introduction to iOS app development and I had experience building
              over 20 apps as part of this course.{" "}
