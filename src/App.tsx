            <p>
              I was first introduced to programming during furlough in 2020. I
              was trying to step out of my comfort zone whilst I had the
              opportunity and wanted to learn something new. I started with a
              free Python course offered as part of a government scheme and
              whilst I was doing this saw an advert on Facebook for a free
              online workshop with a company called SheCodes. After attending
              the workshop, I wanted to know more. Six months on and I had
              completed the SheCodes beginner workshop, SheCodes Plus workshop
              and SheCodes React workshop. Links to my certificates and final
              projects can be found on the links at the top of this page.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoyed programming so much but was still working in my role in
              Customer Success and has been asked to complete a Teaching and
              Training course as part of my role, so I took a break for a few
              months. On the weekends I started to explore Swift Playgrounds on
              my Mac, which I found really fun. In April, I handed in my notice
              for my previous job and decided to focus full time on programming.
              Following the enjoyment from Swift Playgrounds and my love of
              apps, I started an iOS App Development Bootcamp on Udemy. This
              course has been a great introduction to iOS app development and I
              had experience building over 20 apps as part of this course.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am now in the process of developing my own iOS app which has
              been a huge learning experience. I am also building my own backend
              service for my app in Typescript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to join a team and further my
              experience and passion for web and app development and am excited
              about my journey still to come.
            </p>
